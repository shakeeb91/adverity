Question 1
Assuming the login username to all servers is ubuntu and we have public key authentication
(your public key is already on all of those hosts), how would you log in to a server?


Answer:

If the public key already stored inside destination server and the username is same for all than I have written a script which is responsible to just take input name/ip of the server and you can get access to relevant bastion host. 
./script.sh servername

OR

./script.sh ip # here ip is the private IP w.r.t the file shared as inventory list and it will automatically call bastion as a host and ssh to it

For example:
shakeeb@shakeeb-xps-13:~/shakeeb_working$ bash script.sh 192.168.0.1

#than it will take an SSH access to this bastion host: 212.186.105.45

Question 2
There can be thousands of servers in the inventory. You might need to log in remotely multiple
times per hour to arbitrary servers from the list. How would you ease this process?

Answer:

If we need to access thousands of server multiple times than there are many options.
1) Bash script which i have written is responsible to access the bastion host only.
2) If we want to run same command inside all the servers ( or some defined list of host ) than use ANSIBLE. 
We need to write up a playbook who is responsible to automatically SSH and than perform our custom actions accordingly.

Both of the questions are reflecting using some automation technique and i suppose if we can either use this script for SSH or after some modification we can run some commands as well inside the server
OR
Use Ansible playbooks.
